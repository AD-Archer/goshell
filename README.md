# GoShell üñ•Ô∏è  

## Overview  
GoShell is a lightweight shell written in Go, providing basic command execution and system interaction. It serves as a foundation for understanding shell environments and how they can be built from scratch.  

## Features  
- Supports basic command execution  
- Handles user input efficiently  
- Minimal and extensible design  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ad-archer/goshell.git
   cd goshell
   ```  
2. Build the shell:  
   ```bash
   go build -o goshell  
   ```  
3. Run the shell:  
   ```bash
   ./goshell  
   ```  

## Usage  
Once inside GoShell, you can execute standard system commands just like in a regular terminal.  

## Future Plans  
- Implement built-in commands  
- Add support for piping and redirections  
- Improve error handling
